## What's This About?

Hey! We're two high school students who love pets and coding. We noticed that pet owners don't really have their own dedicated space online to connect, share, and help each other out. So we built PetConnect - think of it as Instagram + TownSquare + ChatGPT but just for pet parents! 🐕🐈

## The Problem We're Solving

Pet owners are scattered across different apps and groups. You're searching Facebook for lost pet info, asking on Reddit about weird symptoms, scrolling Instagram for cute pics, and trying to find local meetups on random websites. We thought, "Why not put everything in ONE place?" So we did!

## Cool Stuff You Can Do

### 📱 Social Features (The Fun Stuff!)

**Feed & Stories**
- Post photos of your pets (because who doesn't love showing off their fur babies?)
- Stories that disappear after 24 hours (like Instagram!)
- Like and comment on other people's posts
- Follow your favorite pet accounts

**Your Profile**
- Show off all your pets in one place
- Write a cool bio
- Add unlimited pets (yes, even if you have 5 cats like some of us want to 😅)
- Edit your profile anytime

**Direct Messages**
- Chat with other pet owners in real-time
- Make new friends who get your pet obsession
- Plan playdates and meetups

### 🤖 AI Tools (The Smart Stuff!)

This is where it gets really cool - we used AI to make life easier for pet owners:

**AI Search Helper**
- Start typing and it suggests what you're looking for
- No more endless scrolling to find stuff!

**Playdate Matchmaker** 🎯
- Our AI analyzes pet profiles and finds compatible playmates
- Considers age, size, energy level, and personality
- Because not every dog wants to play with every dog!

**Health Advisor Chat** 💬
- Ask questions about your pet's health, diet, or behavior
- Get instant answers from AI trained on pet care
- Like having a vet assistant available 24/7
- (Still gotta go to a real vet for serious stuff though!)

**Symptom Checker** 🩺
- Describe what's wrong with your pet
- AI tells you how urgent it is
- Suggests possible conditions
- Gives you next steps
- Super helpful for those 2 AM panic moments!

### 🏘️ Community Features (The Helpful Stuff!)

**Forums**
- Ask questions, share advice, have discussions
- Different topics for different things
- Learn from other pet owners' experiences

**Lost & Found** 🚨
- Post alerts when your pet goes missing
- See lost pet alerts in your area
- Help reunite pets with their families
- This one's really important to us!

**Pet Adoption** 💕
- Browse pets looking for homes
- Find your next best friend
- Give a pet a second chance

**Events & Meetups** 📅
- Discover local pet events
- Register for meetups
- Organize your own gatherings
- Make IRL friends (not just online!)

**Tips & Advice** 📚
- Daily pet care tips
- Links to helpful guides
- Training advice
- Health resources

## Tech Stack (For the Nerds 🤓)

We built this using:
- **React** - for the frontend (it's what all the cool kids use)
- **Firebase** - for backend stuff (auth, database, storage)
- **Tailwind CSS** - to make it look pretty
- **Claude AI API** - for all the smart AI features
- **shadcn/ui** - for nice-looking components

We chose warm brown/beige colors because they feel cozy and pet-friendly!

## Try It Out!

**Live Demo:** https://studio--studio-2533192089-b3870.us-central1.hosted.app/

**Test Account:**

- Password: `Test@123`

Feel free to explore! We added mock data so it doesn't look empty.

## What We Learned

Building this taught us SO much:
- How to work with AI (Claude is pretty amazing!)
- Firebase Studio is both awesome and sometimes frustrating
- Designing an app is harder than it looks
- Managing a big project with lots of features
- Git and GitHub (we messed up the repo like 3 times 😅)
- How to debug when everything breaks at late in the night

## Future Ideas

If we had more time (or less homework), we'd add:
- Video calls for virtual playdates
- AR filters for pet photos (like Snapchat!)
- Integration with vet appointment booking
- Pet product marketplace
- More AI features (maybe AI-generated pet names?)

## Special Thanks

- Our parents for letting us spend time coding
- GradCircle & TAOSHA for organizing this hackathon
- Anthropic for Claude AI
- Google for Firebase Studio
- All furry beings for being the inspiration!
